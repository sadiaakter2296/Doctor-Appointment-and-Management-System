# Import Error Fix - AlertTriangle Missing

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the `ReferenceError: AlertTriangle is not defined` error in the BillingManagement component.

## Problem
The `AlertTriangle` icon was being used in the dynamic revenue metrics but was not imported from lucide-react library.

## Location
- **File**: `src/components/billing/BillingManagement.jsx`
- **Line**: 224 - Used in the "Overdue Revenue" metric icon

## Solution Applied
Added `AlertTriangle` to the import statement from lucide-react:

```jsx
// Before
import {
  Search,
  ChevronDown,
  BarChart3,
  CreditCard,
  Clock,
  CheckCircle,
  // ... other imports
  AlertCircle,  // Had this
  Star,
  // ... rest
}

// After  
import {
  Search,
  ChevronDown,
  BarChart3,
  CreditCard,
  Clock,
  CheckCircle,
  // ... other imports
  AlertCircle,
  AlertTriangle,  // Added this
  Star,
  // ... rest
}
```

## Result
✅ Application now runs without errors
✅ All billing page functionality working correctly
✅ Revenue metrics display properly with AlertTriangle icon
✅ No more module loading errors

## Verification
- Hot module replacement successful
- No TypeScript/JavaScript errors
- All icons rendering correctly
- Complete billing page functionality intact

The billing management system is now fully operational with all buttons and features working as expected.
